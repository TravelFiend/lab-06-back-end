## Overview
Back end server to provide data to the already established front-end code

## Getting Started
NPM install express & dotenv.  Create a .env file that contains port info and add that file to the .gitignore file. Deploy via Heroku.

## Architecture
This app already has a front-end that requires data.  We are using Node and Express to create the data for the front-end code.
